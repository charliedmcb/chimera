        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>
        This website is designed to generate decklists for the Chimera format of netrunner.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Chimera?</h3>
        <p>
            Chimera is a newly designed format of netrunner, which involves randomly generating “legal”<b>*</b> eternal+<b>**</b> Ampere, and Nova decklists. <br>
            <br>
            <b>*</b>Ampere is not restricted to the max 2 agendas from each faction requirement on its identity (note: this makes it so jnet may label its decklists as even casual illegal) <br>
            <b>**</b>including all terminal directive cards (campaign cards too, which were never legal in tournament play) <br>
            <br>
            From playtesting the above changes made the format the most fun! <br>
        </p>

        <h3>How to play:</h3>
        <p>
            1. Generate decklists using the following url: <a href="/new-deck">new deck</a> <br>
            2. Copy your decklist Ampere, or Nova into <a href="https://jinteki.net">jnet</a> (note: the text is already formatted to align with jnet’s deck building field) <br>
            &emsp;[<b>suggestion</b>: copy the deck without looking at it. We found playing the decks completely blind to be the most fun in playtesting] <br>
            3. Hop in a game with someone else playing Chimera on the opposite side <br>
            4. Enjoy! <br>
            5. Give feedback/ideas/suggestions for the format to <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/santa181">santa181</a> on Discord! <br>

        <h3>The Algorithm:</h3>

        <p>
        Corp: <br>
        &emsp;1. Agendas are added until the corp is at 20 agenda points. <br>
        &emsp;2. The corp is given a base of 9 econ cards. <br>
        &emsp;3. The corp is given a base of 3 etr Ice. <br>
        &emsp;4. The remainder of the corp's deck is filled out with any non-agenda cards, until it hits 49 cards. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Runner: <br>
        &emsp;1. Runner is given one of each breaker in the form of <b>Peacock</b>, <b>Aurora</b>, and <b>Creeper</b> <br>
        &emsp;2. The runner is given a base of 8 econ cards. <br>
        &emsp;3. The remainder of the runner's deck is filled out with any cards, until it has 40 cards. <br>
        </p>

        Econ Card: <br>
        &emsp;- Philosophy: Econ cards are meant to feel like a generally good and consistently reliable card to <br>
        &emsp;provide some economic value. However, they should not be too strong, or the only econ card you need. <br>
        &emsp;Following this pattern cards like Account Siphon, and Magnum Opus do not exist on the econ list. <br>

        Ban List: <br>
        &emsp; - Philosophy: The general intention of balancing Chimera is that "click to draw should feel good"! <br>
        &emsp; Following this pattern "overpowered" cards are not banned, and the bans focus on removing cards that are: <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;1. pointless within the format of singletons and no id abilities/factions. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;2. just below the curve of a card that would feel actually fun to have in your deck. <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;3. lacking consistent synergy with the deck being completely random. <br>
